# Decisions made while building the first SF-000

Wiley asked for a build he could compile in the morning and left the open choices to the build.
Each one is listed here so it can be overruled. Nothing below is locked.

## How it is built

1. **The suite's processors run inside the app.** Every lane, insert, return and master stage is the
   suite's own `SFProcessor`, built in-process and driven by SF-000's clock. This was the fastest
   way to the suite's real sound with its 64-sample chunking, smoothing and oversampling intact.
   The spec's fuller plan (a new registry with tags, plain state in place of SF BUS) is not done;
   `Source/Rig.h` is the one rig file the spec asks for.
2. **The suite's code is copied, not linked.** `suite/` is `SF-Live-Suite` `main` at `4eb9405`.
   One line is changed: the shared-memory bus has its own name, so SF-000 and Live never share one.
3. **Knob values go to the processors on the audio thread**, glided there, so a move lands the same
   way at any buffer size and a long glide does not depend on the screen.
4. **One target.** The checks, the screenshot tool and the knob audit are flags on the app itself.

## Lanes: one fixed model each

| Lane | Plays | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| KICK | KICK 909-TYPE, with KICK 808-TYPE as the layer playing the lows | LAYER brings the 808 body under the 909 |
| CLOSED HAT, OPEN HAT | PERC, HAT 909-TYPE, short and long | |
| CLAP | PERC, CLAP | |
| PERC | STRIKE, MEMBRANE | SIZE, TENSION and MATERIAL take it from a tom to metal to glass |
| BASS | BASS LADDER with SINE SUB layered under it | rolling bass with a steady sub |
| RUMBLE | RUMBLE, REVERB model, fed by the kick and its own steps | its pattern starts empty: the kick drives it |
| LEAD | ACID 303-TYPE | ties slide, hard steps accent |
| CHORD | LEAD module, STAB DUB | one note plays the chord |
| PAD | DUB WASH, chord MIN7, with drift | one held note is a moving minor seventh |
| VOICE | VOICE, RADIO model | a voice over a bad radio link. With no phrase it sings a formant choir; drop a file on the lane for a phrase |

To change one, edit its line in `Source/Rig.h`. The model is a parameter underneath, so a knob or
a snapshot could reach it later.

5. **Knobs map one to one** onto the suite parameter of the same name, across its whole range.
   Nothing is tamed at the edges. Parameters with no knob are fixed in `Rig.h`.
5a. **Two knobs differ from the drawn screen**, because the audit (`SF-000 --audit`) showed they did
   nothing on the chosen model. BASS place 2 is LAYER (the sine sub's level) in place of ACCENT.
   LEAD place 1 is TUNE in place of GLIDE: the 303 model always slides over 60 ms and ignores GLIDE.
5b. **Knobs that need the right conditions to be heard:** BASS GLIDE needs tied steps. VOICE's TUNE,
   SIGNAL and GATE need a loaded phrase. SPREAD on the hats and clap and WIDTH on RUMBLE are stereo
   only. Every other lane knob changes the sound with the starting patterns.
6. **VOICE's stutter is not on top of every model yet.** The suite has STUTTER as a model of its
   own. Stutter over any model needs new sound code and is not in this build.
7. **ALLOC (automatic frequency space) is off** on every lane. It needs the suite's ALLOC module in
   the graph, which is not wired in.

## Mixing and loudness

8. **Lane EQ:** LOW is a shelf below 200 Hz, MID a wide bell at 700 Hz, HIGH a shelf above 2.5 kHz.
   Centre is flat, down cuts to -24 dB, up lifts to +9 dB. It sits after the inserts.
9. **Sends are after the EQ and the level.** SEND A feeds a dub delay (1/8 dotted, ping-pong),
   SEND B a reverb. Both returns are wet only. Each lane starts with sends that suit it.
10. **Master chain:** the lows are made mono below 150 Hz (LOWEND), then TAPE (the suite's DRIVE at
    its tape end), COMP (GLUE, 2:1, slow attack, auto release), LIMIT (the suite's true-peak limiter,
    ceiling -1 dB). One knob each.
11. **The LIMIT knob sets the loudness target** (-16 to -5 LUFS, starting at -9). The limiter's AUTO
    trims its own input slowly until the loudest passage sits at the target. It lifts only a mix
    already within 6 dB of the target, so a breakdown is held where it was. The factory rig
    measures -9.4 LUFS with peaks at -1.1 dBFS.
12. **GR is approximate.** It compares the limiter's output peak with its input peak, so it also
    shows AUTO's trim. A true gain-reduction readout needs a tap inside the limiter.
13. **Lanes are delay-compensated** to the latest one (the kick's pocket needs lookahead), so every
    lane leaves about 21 ms late and together.

## Sequencer

14. **A sixteenth per step**; step rate per lane, probability and timing nudge per step are not in.
15. **Legato and ties.** A gate that reaches the next lit step overlaps it (a slide on ACID, a glide
    on the mono models). If the next step holds the same note, it is a tie: one note, no new attack.
16. **Ratcheted steps do not tie.** Turning a step into a ratchet pulls its gate back to one step.
17. **NOTE steps through all twelve semitones** and OCTAVE through octaves 1 to 5. KEY transposes.
18. **Lanes that take notes:** BASS, LEAD, CHORD, PAD, VOICE (on VOICE a note picks a slice of the
    phrase). The drum lanes play one fixed note.
19. **RANDOM leans to the beat.** Each step has a seeded rank, weighted to quarters, then eighths.
    HITS takes the top of the ranking, so turning it never moves a hit already there.
20. **Generated steps** get velocity 60 % (accents 100 %), gate half a step, no ratchet.

## Snapshots and the snapshot knobs

21. **A snapshot holds** every lane knob, sends, lane EQ, insert types and their knobs, returns,
    generator knobs, KEY and all eleven patterns. It leaves alone TEMPO, GLIDE, the master knobs and
    the snapshot knobs themselves.
22. **A snapshot knob's first snapshot is its zero.** Turning the knob adds, to the base scene, the
    difference between where it is in its sweep and its first snapshot. Knobs stack and clamp.
23. **Only sound knobs morph.** Menus, switches, insert knobs and patterns change on a full recall
    only. Insert knobs could morph when both snapshots hold the same effect; they do not yet.
24. **A recall glides the sound knobs over the GLIDE time** and switches the rest at once. A glide
    starts on the next beat while the clock runs. Knobs moved by hand are immediate.
25. **Pressing a snapshot knob** (double-click) recalls its nearest snapshot as the base scene and
    returns that knob to zero. The spec left open whether to take the in-between state instead.
26. **Five factory snapshots and knobs** (ENERGY, BUILD, ACID, DIST, WARP), each a push in one
    direction from INIT, so the knobs do something on the first run. They are ordinary snapshots:
    rename, delete or rebuild them.
27. **Taking a snapshot does not change the base scene.** Recalling one does.
28. **No audio preview, traits or sound map** in the library yet. A card shows how busy each lane's
    pattern is.

## Screens

29. **AUDIO** is a white key in the top bar. It opens the one set-once dialog (interface, outputs,
    buffer size). Nothing else opens a dialog.
30. **The screen is drawn by the CPU**, repainting only what changed. The spec asks for GPU drawing;
    measure on the Mac first.
31. **Deleting a snapshot** is press-and-hold on the red key, with no question asked.
32. **The stage (dark) palette is not built.** Only the day palette is.
33. **Sheet 1 of the visual language still says legends sit on white plates.** The main screen
    dropped them; the sheet has not been updated.

## Second build (Nov 11): CONFIG, mute and solo, meters

34. **C, M and S are small lettered keys** at the right of every lane, insert and return header, in
    place of the three INS lamps. The letters go on the keys because there is no room for a legend
    under them. C is white (it opens another surface) and black while its panel is open; M lights
    amber, S lights green.
35. **CONFIG moves the top three rows over by two columns** and leaves the sequencer strip alone,
    so the two right-hand columns (and MASTER) are off the screen while it is open. Opening a
    lane's CONFIG makes that lane the active lane.
36. **CONFIG shows every module parameter that has no knob on the main screen**, six to a row, in
    the module's own order, under the module's own display from the suite. Nothing is hidden or
    regrouped yet.
37. **SOLO on an insert plays only what the effect adds:** its MIX is held at full and its own DRY
    switch off while SOLO is lit. MUTE passes the lane round it; the effect keeps running so its
    tail is current when it comes back.
38. **SOLO on a return** silences every lane's dry signal and the other return.
39. **Mute and solo are not stored in snapshots.** They are kept in the session, so they come back
    when the app is reopened.
40. **A gate of exactly one step is not a tie.** New steps start with a whole-step gate, so two lit
    steps side by side strike twice. Legato needs the gate dragged a little past the next lit
    step's edge (the bar shows a link). The factory LEAD pattern keeps its two slides this way.
41. **Generated steps** now start at velocity 75 (accents 100) and a whole-step gate, as hand-made
    ones do.
42. **CLEAN SLATE cannot be lost:** if it is deleted it is back the next time the app starts.
43. **Dropped files are remembered by the session, not by snapshots.** A snapshot recall never
    loads audio from disk.
44. **VOICE starts with a clearer radio (SIGNAL 70 %) and a one-beat step**, so a dropped phrase
    is plainly heard. The first build's step was a tenth of a second long, which is the likely
    reason the phrase "did not seem to load": the offline test shows the file loading and
    changing what the lane plays.
45. **Lane meters read each lane after its EQ, mute and solo**, before the master chain. The MIX
    pair reads the final output.
46. **A gliding knob is green with a white mark at its target.** Knobs moved by hand never show it.

## Not verified

- Built and run on Linux only. It has not been compiled on macOS or heard by anyone.
- The mix is balanced by measurement: levels, loudness, peak. It needs ears.
